This document describes the requirements for google-images-downloader.  The 
template for the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a subset of the Volere
template~\citep{RobertsonAndRobertson2012}.  If you make further modifications
to the template, you should explicitly state what modifications were made.

\section{Project Drivers}

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}

The purpose of this project is to re-create an open source software application following the software development life cycle, for the software engineering course 3XA3. This project will give the group exposure and experience in how to properly develop a software product from beginning to end.

The project chosen is a google images downloader command line tool that will allow end users to download a certain number of google images given keywords. We want this product primarily to be able to help those involved in machine learning, and secondarily those involved in art.

\subsection{The Stakeholders}

The following subsections will discuss various stakeholders in the product being developed.

\subsubsection{The Client}

Dr. Asghar Bokhari, the professor of our course, and the TA responsible for marking all our deliverables, Andrew Lucentini.

\subsubsection{The Customers}

There are two main types of customers who would use the product, those involved in machine learning and those in art.

Individuals, or companies who are using machine learning algorithms or neural networks for image recognition purposes could benefit from this product as it would allow them to quickly obtain a large variety of images on a specific keyword. This can help them make their models more accurate and robust.

Artists may use this tool for projects requiring many images based off a single keyword such as collages or reference work.

\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}

Other stakeholders include Google Images because their service is being used to scrape images off of it.

\subsection{Mandated Constraints}

\subsubsection{Schedule Constraints}

The project deliverables must be met on time according to the project description. The remaining ones are included below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Proof of Concept Demonstration - February 11, 2020
    \item Test Plan Revision 0 - February 28, 2020
    \item Design \& Document Revision 0 - March 13, 2020
    \item Revision 0 Demonstration - March 17, 2020
    \item Final Demonstration (Revision 1) - March 31, 2020
    \item Final Documentation (Revision 1) - April 6, 2020
\end{itemize}

Further breakdown of these deliverables their respective group member assignments can be found in our Gantt Chart.

\subsubsection{Solution Constraints}

Description: The product shall be developed in Python 3.
Rationale: The existing implementation of the software is in Python 3, making it easier to re-develop if it is in the same language.
Fit criterion: The software is programmed in Python 3.

Description: The product shall get the image URLs from Google Images by scraping the HTML code returned.
Rationale: The existing implementation of the software designed its solution in this was so since we are re-developing it, that component of the solution will remain the same.
Fit criterion: The application works by scraping HTML code to get URLs

\subsubsection{Budget Constraints}

The budget for this project is \$0 so the software must be able to built without spending any money.

\subsubsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}

Since the purpose of the project is to re-implement an existing open source project, the existing version of the software will be reference heavily when developing this version. The existing software can be found at \url{https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download}.

In addition to some common python libraries, urllib, urllib2, \& httplib will be used to manage and navigate URLs in the application.

\subsubsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}

The software product being developed will use the Google Images application to download images onto the local computer. The application will use the image URL links that are embedded in the HTML code for the image returned in a Google Images search query. These URLs are stored in 'data-iurl' under the 'img' tag.

\subsubsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}

The software product being developed will be installed on users local machines, or on servers, to function as a command line tool.

\subsection{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{\bf Naming Conventions and Terminology}
\begin{tabular}{ |c|c| } 
 \hline
 \textbf{Name/Term} & \textbf{Definition}\\ 
 The System & The product defined in this document\\
 HTML & Hypertext Markup Language \\ 
 URL & The address of a website or file on the internet \\ 
 Python 3 & The third version of the python programming language \\
 Keyword & The search term used to find images\\
 Limit & The number of images the user wished to download\\
 Google Images & The image search engine provided by Google\\
 Search Constraints & restrictions images must follow such as size or file type\\
 JPEG & A format for image files\\ 
 
 \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}

It is assumed that users of the application have basic computer skills and are able to type commands on a command line given examples. It is also being assumed that users have basic knowledge of pictures, like what aspect ratio means, or colour type refers to.

\section{Functional Requirements}

\subsection{The Scope of the Work and the Product}

\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}

In order for the product to function as intended, the system must interact with Google Images. As a result there is a need to understand how Google Images works. This is because the original implementation of this product scrapes the HTML off of Google Images and then finds the links to the original images in the scraped HTML. Therefore, the specifics of what is required background knowledge for this product is how images are stored on the website so they can be effectively found in the scraped HTML. 

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item [BE1:] The User Requests an Image.
        \begin{itemize}[wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
            \item [Inputs:] \phantom{empty}
                \begin{itemize} [wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
                    \item Keyword
                    \item Limit
                    \item Search Constraints
                \end{itemize}
                
            \item [Outputs:] \phantom{empty}
                \begin{itemize} [wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
                    \item Images downloaded to computer
                \end{itemize}
            \item [Summary:] \phantom{empty}
                \begin{itemize} [wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
                    \item Download a number of images equal to the limit of the given keyword that also match any other given search constraints.
                \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Individual Product Use Cases}

The main use case of this product is the user actor requesting an image. This use case can include the user specifying optional input arguments such as a limit of images, or other search constraints such as prefixes for searching or the size of images wanted.\\

\noindent The following scenarios will outline a general interaction between a user actor and the system for both the main use case, and sub use cases. 

\begin{enumerate}[label=Scenario \arabic*:, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item The user requests an image without specifying a keyword. The system will return a message with the proper format for an image request and remind the user that a keyword is required.
    
    \item The user requests an image with a specified keyword. The system will retrieve images from Google Images that match the specified keyword. Since a limit on images was not specified the system will download the 100 images matching the search criteria. Since an output directory was not specified, the system will download the images into a downloads directory located in the same directory where the program was executed.
    
    \item The user requests a limit of 50 images with the keyword "Cat". The system will retrieve the first 50 images off of Google Images when Cat is used as the search term. Since an output directory was not specified, the system will download the images into a downloads directory located in the same directory where the program was executed.
    
    \item The user requests a limit of 50 images with the keyword "Cat". The user specifies a download directory of "./Images/Cat/". The system will retrieve the first 50 images off of Google Images when Cat is used as the search term. Since an output directory was specified, the system will create a new directory named images then inside images create a new directory called cats. The images will then be downloaded into the new cats directory. If the images and cats directory already exists, the system will use the existing directory rather than creating a new one.
    
    \item The user requests a limit of 100 images with a specified keyword and download directory. The user also specifies specific search constraints. The system will search with the keyword and download 100 images that match the keyword and don't violate any of the search constraints. For example if the search constraint is a file type of JPEG, the system will only download JPEG images. The images will be downloaded into the specified directory, creating it if it does not already exist.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}[label=FR \arabic*:, wide=0pt, leftmargin=*]
    \item The user shall be able to download images that match a given keyword.
    \item[Rationale:] This is the main functionality of the product. With this, users will be able to download multiple images that all match the keyword given with just one command.
    \\
    \item The user shall be able to specify the number of images they want
    \item[Rationale:] This allows the user to select how many images they want and will be a useful quality of life feature when the user knows approximately how many images they want.
\end{enumerate}
