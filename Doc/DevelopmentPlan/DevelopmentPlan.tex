\section{Introduction}
This document outlines many aspects of how we intend to develop our product, 
including our team specifics, technological details, and project management.

\section{Team Meeting Plan}
Meetings will take place every lab session, which is twice a week on Tuesday and 
Wednesday from 2:30 - 4:30 pm in ITB 236. If extra meetings are needed, a time 
and location will be found that fits for everyone in the group.

The roles individuals take in meetings are outlined below in Section~\ref{roles}. 

An agenda will be set by the project manager (Joshua Guinness), before the 
meeting and will be sent to the Facebook group chat so everyone in the group is 
aware. The project manager will chair the meeting and will ensure that this 
agenda is adhered to during the meetings. Any next steps, deliverables, actions 
that need to take place will be agreed to by the individuals at the end of the meeting. 

\section{Team Communication Plan}
In order to properly communicate between team members on important issues 
related to code and development, we will make use of git issue tracking in order 
to make use of all the tools git provides us and have a logged record of all the 
issues and problems that occurred during the development process.

For team meetings and general planning, our team will make use of Discord for 
remote meetings and Facebook Messenger for meeting planning and coordination.

\section{Team Member Roles}
\label{roles}
All members will also act as developers, designing and implementing the code for 
our program.

\subsection{Joshua Guinness - Project Manager}
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsible for meeting minutes and other supporting documentation
\item Will ensure project deadlines are adhered to and everyone is kept on track
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Nicholas Mari - Software Tester}
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsible for testing the software and ensuring it meets our requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sam Crawford - Git Specialist}
\begin{itemize}
\item Responsible for fixing issues arising with Git, such as merge conflicts 
\end{itemize}

\section{Git Workflow Plan}
We will be using trunk-based development for our workflow. We will branch off 
of the master branch only when needed for implementing a specific feature if 
necessary; otherwise we will be working in the master branch, especially for 
smaller updates like modifying documentation. This will allow us to avoid 
frequent and messy merge conflicts. As we are just getting started, and since 
we’re working with a small team, using this method of code development will 
allow us to develop our code and write our documentation quickly with minimal 
wait times or delays \cite{trunkbased}.

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}
In order to provide a proof of concept for our product, we will demonstrate its 
basic functionality. For example, the proof of concept will demonstrate that the 
Python script can download multiple images from the Internet. However, as the 
proof of concept intends to focus on the basic functions, the additional 
features such as input flags, whitelisting, a vetting process, or a GUI will not 
be implemented in this version.

\section{Technology}
Programming Language: Python 3
IDEs: Visual Studio/Sublime Text
Testing Framework: pytest
Document Generation: doxygen
Linters: pylint/flake8

\section{Coding Style}
We will be basing our style guide off of Google’s style guide for Python, with 
some modifications. Linting will be done as per our own discretion, either with 
pylint or flake8; this is subject to revision in the future and will possibly be 
standardized. We will not be considering Python 2 compatibility, type annotating 
functions or variables, or using shebang lines, unless we decide it is 
advantageous during the development process. All functions, variables, classes, 
modules, etc. will be named with camel case convention, with the first letter’s 
capitalization depending on the type (ie. classes will use 
\texttt{UpperCamelCase} and functions will use \texttt{lowerCamelCase}); the 
rationale for this is improving readability and reducing long function names.

\section{Project Schedule}
The \href{run:./../../ProjectSchedule/Gantt-Chart.pdf}{Gantt Chart} can be found in the project schedule folder on the repository or by clicking the link in this section.

\section{Project Review}
This will be left unfilled until Revision 1.
